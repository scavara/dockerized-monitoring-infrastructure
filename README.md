### What is it?
Revolves in and around prometheus, grafana and few tsdb's to chose from

### How to use it? 
After cloning, checkout the appropriate branch for configs. Using one VM per branch.
Use "git branch -a" to view all the branches. 

- prometheus: prometheus master, alertmanager, externals that should be placed on host server

### Credits
To all good people on github and beyond, which configs I reused - very little was pulled out of my ass. You expected something else under credits, didn't you!? ;)
